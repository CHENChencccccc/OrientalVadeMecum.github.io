					<h1>Humanities in XIAN</h1>
					<p>
						I remember ten years ago, I came to Xi'an for the first time to attend an event conference. At
						that time, the plane arrived in Xi'an, and then took a taxi directly to the hotel, from the
						airport to the hotel is not too far, about half an hour to arrive, all the way to see, found
						that it is also very life. Due to the early arrival of the day, after checking in at the hotel,
						I went to the clock tower to stroll around and feel the atmosphere of life in the city center.
						Of course, the least thing to do is to go to Muslim Street to eat special snacks. At that time,
						there were not as many tourists in Muslim Street as it does now, and you could see a lot of
						people, but it was not as crowded as it is now. Of course, it is indispensable to eat special
						lamb puff buns, cold skin, meat dumplings, etc., as a northerner who eats sesame sauce cold skin
						from snack cold skin, it is like discovering a new continent. The special food in Xi'an tastes
						very fragrant and pure, although it is a little unaccustomed to eating, but I still like it.
					<p>
						Ten years ago, smartphones were not as widespread as they are now, and network information was
						not developed, so I forgot how I knew about local famous attractions at that time. I remember
						that after going to eat in Muslim Street, it was getting late, so I went to the Big Wild Goose
						Pagoda to see the music fountain. At that time, I didn't know when the performance would start,
						but I knew that so many people were waiting, so I followed along. When the fountain show really
						started, although I knew it was very beautiful, I was still shocked by such a big battle, the
						high and low fountain with the ups and downs of the music showed a high or low, rapid or slow
						gushing, thousands of square meters of fountains dancing at the same time, it was really not
						exciting. After seeing the fountain, I rushed back to the hotel due to business the next day.
					</p>
					<p>
						At that time, I also sighed that Xi'an is really a very good city, whether it is living or doing
						business. Now settled in Xi'an, two years ago went to the rehabilitation road tea street, found
						that today is not the past, online shopping and the epidemic, so that offline tea shops can be
						closed. After visiting the Tea Street on Rehabilitation Road, I set out on my way back. In just
						a few days, I have a preliminary impression of Xi'an, and there is a comfortable, interesting
						and cordial feeling, which makes me yearn for life in Xi'an. In fact, since I was a child, I
						have lived in many cities and traveled to many cities, but whether a city can make people
						comfortable, whether it can make people feel at ease, is really a wonderful feeling, maybe this
						is a feeling like love at first sight.
