					<h1>IF BEIJING HAS A COLOR</h1>
					<p>
						If Beijing has a color, it must be the sunset red of the Shichahai sunset. I have seen the
						sunset in Shichahai many times, and each time it has a different beauty. Especially in
						midsummer, the sunset in Beijing is truly stunning. The pink sunset falls on the lake surface of
						Houhai, and the cruise ship lies on the pink ocean, like a movie scene. In summer, it is really
						recommended to go to Shichahai to watch the sunset, sit on the edge of Houhai, watch the people
						come and go, and watch the boats ripple. Or enjoy the sunset on a cruise ship and become a
						passerby in someone else's camera.
					</p>
					<p>
						If there are colors in Beijing, it must be the blooming flowers in spring. Why don't we look
						forward to spring in Beijing? After the scorching summer heat, the rustling autumn, and the
						severe winter cold, we have finally arrived at the blooming flowers in spring. Everything is
						gathering momentum for the recovery of all things. The spring in Beijing is short but stunning,
						and many scenic spots need to arrange a reasonable schedule for flower appreciation when the
						flowers are concentrated and open. The best recommendation is to visit the Yulan Flower in the
						Imperial City Root Site Park at the end of March, and to admire the cherry blossoms in the
						Yuyuantan Park in early April. Yuyuantan is the largest cherry blossom scenic area in Beijing,
						and the cherry blossoms under the blue sky are truly beautiful and romantic. The rights within
						the park have also been opened, and the weeping willows sway in the wind, rippling on the lake's
						surface with blue waves.

					<h1>Travel Stragegy</h1>
					<p>
						Day 1:
						Visit Tiananmen Square: This large public square is the heart of Beijing and a symbol of China's
						political power. It is home to many important buildings, including the Forbidden City and the
						National Museum of China.
						Explore the Forbidden City: This palace complex was the home of Chinese emperors for nearly 500
						years. Be sure to take your time and explore the many halls, pavilions, and courtyards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day 2:
						Visit the Great Wall of China: No trip to Beijing is complete without a visit to the Great Wall.
						Mutianyu is a great section to visit, with stunning views and less crowded than other sections.
						Explore the Summer Palace: This sprawling complex of gardens, pavilions, and temples was the
						summer retreat of Chinese emperors. Stroll around the lake, climb up to the Tower of Buddhist
						Incense, or admire the intricate architecture.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day 3
						Visit the Temple of Heaven: This temple complex was used by Chinese emperors to pray for good
						harvests. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and features stunning architecture and gardens.
						Explore the Hutongs: These narrow alleyways are a glimpse into old Beijing. You can take a
						rickshaw tour, explore the shops and cafes, or simply wander around.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day 4:
						Visit the National Stadium (Bird's Nest): This iconic stadium was built for the 2008 Olympics
						and is now a popular tourist attraction. You can take a tour, admire the architecture, and learn
						about the history of the Olympics.
						Stroll through the Beihai Park: This park is a tranquil oasis in the heart of the city. Enjoy a
						walk around the lake, climb up to the pagoda on top of the hill, or relax in a pavilion.
						Of course, this is just a sample itinerary, and there are many more things to do and see in
						Beijing. I hope this helps you plan your trip!

						1、Four Seasons Minfu Roast Duck: Of course, you have to eat roast duck when you come to Beijing,
