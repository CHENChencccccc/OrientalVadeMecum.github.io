					<p>
						Wukang Road: Those who cannot write poetry want to write poetry, those who cannot draw want to
						draw, and those who cannot sing want to sing. It feels wonderful. Many historical celebrities'
						former residences, century old buildings, and endless shops have made Wukang Road a must-have
						stop for travel on the train.
					</p>
					<p>
						Changle Road: a road that combines fashion, romance, and nostalgia. Qian Zhongshu and Zhang
						Ailing have also left their stories here, and Changle Road is also my favorite road on this
						trip. It used to be the birthplace of the Chinese fashion brand. Now, there are many
						characteristic literary and art shops along the road. There are some beautiful old western-style
						houses along the way. People living here must be very happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Julu Road: In the daytime, this place is filled with inconspicuous garden houses and market
						houses. When night falls, Julu Road takes on a unique look, providing a great experience of
						Shanghai's bar and nightclub culture.

					<h1>Travel Stragegy</h1>
					<p>
						Day 1:
						Start your day with a visit to the Green Lake Park, a popular park with locals and tourists
						alike. Take a leisurely walk around the lake, enjoy the scenic views and watch people practicing
						Tai Chi or dancing.
						Head to the Yunnan Provincial Museum, which offers a glimpse into the province's rich history
						and culture. The museum has several exhibitions on the diverse ethnic groups in Yunnan and
						displays artifacts from the region's ancient past.
						In the evening, visit the Kunming Night Market, a lively street market with an array of local
						snacks, street food, and souvenirs. Try some of the local delicacies such as the rice noodles
						and Yunnan-style BBQ.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day 2:
						Take a day trip to the Stone Forest, a UNESCO World Heritage site located about 90 km from
						Kunming. The Stone Forest is a unique limestone formation that has been eroded over millions of
						years, creating a forest-like landscape of towering rocks and pinnacles.
						On your way back from the Stone Forest, stop by the Bai Minority Village, a traditional Bai
						village that showcases their unique architecture, culture, and customs. Take a stroll around the
						village and visit some of the local workshops to see how Bai people make their traditional
						handicrafts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day 3:
						Start your day with a visit to the Golden Temple, a Buddhist temple located on the Mingfeng
						Hill. The temple is famous for its large copper temple building, which is covered in gold leaf
						and shines brightly in the sunlight.
						Visit the Yuantong Temple, one of the oldest and most important temples in Kunming. The temple
						is known for its beautiful architecture, tranquil atmosphere, and large collection of Buddhist
						statues and relics.
						End your day by visiting the Western Hills, a scenic mountain range located just outside of
						Kunming. Take a cable car ride to the top of the mountain to enjoy panoramic views of Kunming
						and the Dianchi Lake. You can also visit the Dragon Gate, a series of caves and temples carved
						into the side of the mountain.
